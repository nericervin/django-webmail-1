# Development roadmap #

I'm going to attempt to make a roadmap for the milestones I would like to reach. I will attempt to stick to this as well as I can with my other obligations in life.

I'll also try to keep this updated as things get completed and as (inevitable) slips happen.

Keep in mind that it's pretty much just me working on this project right now.

I haven't had a lot of time to work on this project for a bit, so I'm going to revise the remaining tasks, move them out a bit, and make the release dates a little less precise.
